# Geek Beacon
Geek Beacon Designs/ Documentation

This is a central repository of public documentation both technical 
and otherwise.

A pretty version should be created and published out of these md files.

Potential tools are:
  - https://docusaurus.io/
  - Pandoc
  - Gitbook
  - Mkdocs


Please create a pull request file under docs/ in order to contribute.

Everything is OSS like always.
