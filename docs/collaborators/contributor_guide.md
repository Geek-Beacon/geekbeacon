You will see a view which will show you your posts.  You may update/edit/create a new page and a new post.  

For the most part you will mainly be adding new content under the posts category.

You can hit the + to add a variety of different elements. If the standard layout doesn't support your needs the Markdown and HTML cards will let you do virtually anything.  Code Inject allows you to add additional CSS/JS as needed.  Please reach out to our @Editors team if you need anything installed globally.  Maybe others have the same needs!
