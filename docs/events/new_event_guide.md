## **Step 1 - Plan & Prep Timelines ** 

**Days before the event: Planning, Decide Medium**



*   **Decision Made on the Topic:** (example: A game decided [from the forums](https://forum.geekbeacon.org/t/game-night-resources/629) before the event to play, or a topic like a [Cybersecurity Study Group](https://forum.geekbeacon.org/t/cybersecurity-class-study-group/714)) 
*   OR decide on making it a social hour/Discord (topic discussion without video) or [Jitsi Meeting](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) (for topic discussions with video)

*   **Come up with a format as so to put within the [forums in the appropriate group project](https://forum.geekbeacon.org/c/group-projects/40)**
1. Guideline for formatting these posts: 
2. Title (What is your event/group/topic proposal)
3. Brief Description of event/group/topic
4. Who is leading it 
5. Place where action items, conversations or collabs are happening (if not on this forum, such as Trello)

## **Step 4 - Content Creation from Events**

Events are fun and unifying and great! Being able to create **content** like clips, stand alone videos are even better - because they will be shown for years to come and really help with growth. Here is an example of making a promo video from previous events, but it could really be as simple as publishing un-edited clips on social. **Link to entire video is here! **

#### Future Events: Questions to Ask the Group


### 1.  Agree on specified time to meet for discussion and planning



1. Stick to date and time, ensure all people set time aside for meeting.
2. Discuss and coordinate times for event start and expected run times.
3. Check scheduling proposal with HR Scheduling Lead
4. List all desired parts of the event;
    1. Is it a simple regulated show, such as scripted or unscripted AMA?
    2. Is it a regular live gaming session?
        1. How many games are planned? Is it variety or single focus?
        2. Community or solo or team?
    3. Is it something else?
    4. Is it multiple things?
5. Complete rough draft/outline of event by conclusion of meeting.


### 2. Set time and date to finalize plans and operating procedures.



1. Something about testing everything **before the stream **goes live, amirite? 


### 3. Standard Operating Procedure for streaming



1. Define the standard tools required for a stream.
2. Link to YouTube videos/ tutorials on how to set up and use the tools.
3. Document the tools used, getting started on starting your own Twitch, whatâ€™s involved, what to sign up for, what to configure.
