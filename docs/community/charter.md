# Geek Beacon -- Charter

## 1 Executive Committee

Since its inception, Geek Beacon has been structured as outlined below. This structure is subject to change, provided that the correct amendments have been passed.

**Positions**

*Founders* - hold the highest officer position. This role represents both an honorific and an executive position. Individuals who go above and beyond the call of duty in service of Geek Beacon are appointed to this position. Founders are permanent members of the Executive Panel, with full voting privileges. If a founder is believed to no longer be acting in the best interest of Geek Beacon, they can be removed by a vote of non-confidence.

*Senior Officers* - hold the second-highest officer position and report directly to the Founders. Senior Officers oversee the various tracks of development, business growth, content development. Additionally, they also coordinate with Track Leaders regarding the work to be done.

*Track Leaders* - hold the third-highest officer position and are granted voting privileges. These individuals are responsible for the development of particular tracks. Tracks, in turn, are areas of research or development involving business, engineering and other facets of Geek Beacon. Members are elevated to the position of Track Leaders in order to aid them in various undertakings in support of Geek Beacon.  

Example positions:  Engineering leader, Content Creator track leader.  Track Leaders most likely map out to specific departments defined in the Department Proposal document. _

**NonVoting Leadership Positions**

*Project Leader* - Every Development (Engineering, Business, Marketing, Graphic Designs or otherwise) has a leader which is responsible for the coordinations of volunteers and making sure the required assets are being delivered.  Naturally we are all volunteers and none of us are expected to drop everything in favor of the work we volunteered for but communication and redundancy is crucial.  Anything with a timeline should always be shared among the group so others can pick up the slack if need be.  As such every project has a lead and co-leader.

*Project Co-Leader* - Is a fellow individual who leads a particular project.  Is a second in command after the Project Lead and can be consulted for direction when the Project Lead is missing.  If dispute occurs between the project leaders, the track leader is responsible for resolving such conflicts.

*Moderators* _Are non-voting members of GB at large and are responsible for the moderation and policing of various aspects of the GB community.  That might have a voting status within the niche that they are responsible for.   But the direction of GB at large is not impacted by the voting cast by standard Moderators.  Moderators can be nominated ad-hoc by the community leader, but the information needs to be communicated to the track leader and any nomination can be vetoed by Founder, MC or the Track Leader.


### 1.1 Visual Representation of Hierarchy:

![Seperator](/img/community/charter_hierarchy.png)


   Example of communication with leaders, officers and mods: 

   Weekly 1:1 with Leader + Officer, Monthly/Quarterly All Hands,


### 1.2 Sub Entity Governance Bodies:

Although Project Leader, Moderators and such do not have a voting right in the Geek Beacon track.  The vision that is passed on from the track lead can be executed at the discretion of the Project Leaders and volunteers on the project.  How decisions are made within the particular project is up to the project lead/co-leader.

It is within the realm of possibilities to have a voting hierarchy within a large enough project to decide on implementation details or direction of said project.  As such Geek Beacon non-voting parties can have a say on how the particular track they are involved in further develops and grows.   

Example:  Discord can have its own hierarchy and system of decision making at the discretion of the project lead.  He has full autonomy on how to run his project short of the decisions made that conflict with the interact of the track lead or geek beacon at large. _

## 2. Structure of Government

The Governmental structure is set up into 3 tiers with build in checks and balances for the various groups.    

1. **Executive Branch** -- Is held by the Founder and has Veto rights over any decision if the individual who holds the office sees the motion as being against the values of GB.  Or will be a deterrent to the organization at large.  The decision to veto or not is at the person’s discretion.
2. **House of Lords** -- Is composed of the Senior Officers.  Any motion needs to be ratified by the House of Lords in order to pass and approved by the Executive Branch.  If a stalemate occurs, the Executive Branch can be invoked as a deciding vote.  
3. **House of Common** -- Is composed of Track leaders and other (if any exist or are added) voting members.  For motion in specific domains local moderators may cast a vote on the motion.  A motion can only be voted on by the House of Lords if it passes the House of Common.

**Vote of No Confidence:**

A vote of no confidence can be called for any position.  If the vote passes and is ratified by the Executive Branch the person is removed from office and another person has been nominated to fill the office within 30 days of removal.

**Executive Branch Vote Of No Confidence:**

If the Executive branch is seen as no longer representing the values of the community at large a vote of no confidence can be called to the floor.  It needs to be ratified by a majority in the house of common and a ⅔ majority of the House of Lords.  

Limitations:



*   The number of positions for the House of Lords is frozen as it stands.  The number cannot grow or decrease without a ratification to the Charter.   
*   Any person can be removed from said position but the position needs to be filled in within 30 days of removal and the person needs to be approved by the body of governance. 
*   A ratification to the charter requires a ⅔ majority vote in both houses and approval by the Executive branch. 


## 3. Meritocracy and Promotions

Leadership roles are given to those who have proven themselves as valuable members of our community.  

Any voting member can nominate the individual for a position and will hold the position until they choose to step down or are voted out by a vote of no confidence. 

If an officer of the House of Common is out of contact and is unreachable for more than 6 months his position is forfeit. 

## 4. Effective Communication

Be aware that this community is growing rapidly and our leadership will be slowly developing.  We are over 4000 members as it stands and we may not be as responsive as you’d like.  It is important that you contact the appropriate person whenever possible. Certain people at the top are flooded with communication and if we skip the correct protocols are highly unlikely to be able to respond to 3000 messages waiting for them every morning.  In the unlikely event that you need a response and the immediate officer is not available then escalating up the chain is encouraged as long as proper steps have been taken to attempt to get into the contact with the party responsible for overseeing the project in question.


## 5. Organizational Units

Every project will have a select set of leaders.  Every project needs to have more than one person that can perform every operation required.  No resource associated with GB should have less than 2 people able to manage said entity.

Every project leader will fall under the purview of a track leader.  For example.  The site geek beacon project leader might fall under the Web Development Track leader who is then overseen by a Senior Officer which are in turn under the supervision of the founder. 

Very rarely should anything be escalated up the chain but personal argument and points of contention can be arbitrated by the supervising body.  

Any community individual can create a new GIG (Geek Interest Group) as long as there is a group of at least 2 or 3 individuals interested in the project and it has potential beyond a personal project.  Example GIGs are Geeks Abroad, Squirrel Army etc.  

Geek Beacon will try to provide the resources necessary to facilitate the coordination, development, communication necessary to accomplish the goals of the GIG in question within the limits of both budgetary and human resources available.

Geek Beacon reserves the right to deny any GIG if it is not seen to be of benefit to the community at large, does not add any unique value to the community or any other reason that is at the discretion of the executive committee.  

Generally GIG projects should follow the overall tenets and values established by Geek Beacon and further cement the core of what we are and what we believe in.

Mission Statement:

**To create a hub for different types of geeks to share, collaborate and explore their passions in life.**

A new GIG may be approved with a quorum of a majority vote by the Track Leaders.  


## 6. Conflict Of Interest:

We expect leaders to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or other projects they are involved in, and abstain or delegate decisions that may be seen to be self-interested. We expect that everyone who participates in the project does so with the goal of making life better for its users.

When in doubt, ask for a second opinion. Perceived conflicts of interest are important to address; as a leader, act to ensure that decisions are credible even if they must occasionally be unpopular, difficult or favourable to the interests of one group over another.
