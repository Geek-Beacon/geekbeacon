# Geek Beacon Code Of Conduct


# Community

Geek Beacon is a community of nerds, geeks, and other enthusiasts of all types of backgrounds and interests.  We strive to be all-inclusive and bigotry, hate speech and other reprehensible behavior will not be tolerated.  These are the ground rules that we try to abide by in all Geek Beacon activities irrelevant of the medium used to communicate - digital, in person or otherwise.


## **Be Respectful**

You may disagree with someone’s opinion, but respect everyone’s uniqueness and differences.  Nobody will force you to have a particular point of view nor should you force your view upon others.  


## **Be Considerate**

Be mindful of how your words or actions may affect those around you. Always strive to conduct yourself in a courteous, considerate and professional manner.


## **Take Responsibility for your words and actions**

We all make mistakes.  When we do, take responsibility for the words that were said and work with the injured party to make things right.   Once again, we are a welcoming community of people of all sorts of backgrounds and cultures.  What might be construed as a simple jest to your friends might be highly offensive to others.  




## **Be Collaborative**

The root of our community is heavily inspired by the OSS movement. For example, this document is heavily inspired by the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct).  Given our roots, we shared many of the same ideals. 

To this end, we strive for a purpose greater than ourselves. What we produce-  software, code, community, sense of belonging among peers is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the byproduct of many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole. 


## **Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus**

Disagreements are expected.  They are a part of human nature but we do not allow them to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.

We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.


## **Ask for help when unsure**

Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they should be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.


## **Be Communicative**

Much of what is done and accomplished at Geek Beacon is a volunteer project.  We do not expect people to drop their life and join our cause, but if you are unable to fulfil your obligation or what you promised then please let us know earlier rather than later.  You will never be penalized for not being able to attend an event or help with something simply because of other obligations.  

If you take on a project and find yourself needing help or unable to provide the time required to finish it simply reach out and inform the concerned parties.   We all have lives and we do not expect anyone to be losing sleep or forgoing personal obligations in order to get a GB projects off the ground. 


## **Mitigate Communication**

Be aware that this community is growing rapidly and our leadership will be slowly developing.  We are over 3000 members as it stands and we may not be as responsive as you’d like.  It is important that you contact the appropriate person whenever possible.  Certain people at the top are flooded with communication and if we skip the correct protocols are highly unlikely to be able to respond to 3000 messages waiting for them every morning.  


## **Project Structure**

If project is deemed to provide a worthwhile value to the community (See Charter for more details) then forming a GIG (Geek Interest Group) can be done by placing a formal request at: [https://github.com/OSAlt/WishList](https://github.com/OSAlt/WishList) Where you specify the resources you wish to have available:

Ie.  I want to build Skynet:

I required a mailing list, a voice chat and text chat on discord and access to the nuclear launch codes.

The officers will evaluate your request and either reject or reach out with further instruction and access keys.


## **Credit:**

Whenever someone else's work is used it needs to be given credit and referenced as much as possible.  Ie.  Linking to the graphic designer’s website if said person’s artwork was used.
